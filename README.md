## Recent Tech Ventures

🚀 Recently, I had the incredible opportunity to work as a Business Development Manager at a pioneering remittance company powered by Web 3 technology. Operating on the Stellar network, we reimagined cross-border transactions, leveraging the potential of blockchain to revolutionize the remittance industry. In this role, I was instrumental in fostering strategic partnerships, driving growth, and contributing to the company's success.
